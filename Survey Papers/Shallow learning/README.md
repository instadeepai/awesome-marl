A key to the success of MAS is efficient and effective multiagent learning (MAL). The past 25 years have seen a great interest and tremendous progress in the field of MAL. This article introduces and overviews this field by presenting its fundamentals, sketching its historical development, and describing some key algorithms for MAL. Moreover, main challenges that the field is facing today are identified.<br> - </details>

Laurent and Nadine Le Fort-Piat. Cambridge University Press 2012<a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">   </a></summary> In the framework of fully cooperative multi-agent systems, independent (non-communicative) agents that learn by reinforcement must overcome several difficulties to manage to coordinate. This paper identifies several challenges responsible for the non-coordination of independent agents: Pareto-selection non-stationarity, stochasticity, alter-exploration and shadowed equilibria. A selection of multi-agent domains is classified according to those challenges: matrix games,Boutilier’s coordination game, predators pursuit domains and a special multi-state game.Moreover, the performance of a range of algorithms for independent reinforcementlearners is evaluated empirically.Those algorithms are Q-learning variants: decentralized Q-learning, distributedQ-learning, hystereticQ-learning, recursive frequency maximum Q-value and win-or-learn fast policy hillclimbing. Anoverview of the learning algorithms’ strengths and weaknesses against each challengeconcludes thepaper and can serve as a basis for choosing the appropriate algorithm for a new domain.Furthermore,the distilled challenges may assist in the design of new learning algorithms thatovercome theseproblems and achieve higher performance in multi-agent applications.<br> - </details>

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must instead discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multi-agent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multi-agent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents’ learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim—either explicitly or implicitly—at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.<br> - </details>

JAAMAS 2005<a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">   </a></summary> Cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to MAS problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning, RL or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including RL, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources.

In this survey we givean overview of multi-agent learning research in a spectrum of areas, in-cluding reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, game theory,complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics.MASs range in their description from cooperative to being competitivein nature. To muddle the waters, competitive systems can show appar-ent cooperative behavior, and vice versa. In practice, agents can showa wide range of behaviors in a system, that may either fit the label ofcooperative or competitive, depending on the circumstances. In this sur-vey, we discuss current work on cooperative and competitive MASs andaim to make the distinctions and overlap between the two approachesmore explicit.Lastly, this paper summarizes the papers of the first International work-shop on Learning and Adaptation in MAS (LAMAS) hosted at the fourthInternational Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi AgentSystems (AAMAS’05) and places the work in the above survey.<br> - </details>

With the ever increasing interests in theoretical researches and practical applications, currently there have been a lot of efforts towards providing some solutions to this challenge.

The main objective of this paper is to provide a survey, though not completely on the multiagent reinforcement learning in multi-robot systems. After reviewing important advances in this field, some challenging problems and promising research directions are analyzed.

DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focuses on the information management aspects of systems with several components working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behavior management in collections of several independent entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to the field and as an organizational framework. A series of general multiagent scenarios are presented. For each scenario, the issues that arise are described along with a sampling of the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presented techniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagent systems can be and have been used to build complex systems. When options exist, the techniques presented are biased towards machine learning approaches. Additional opportunities for applying machine learning to MAS are highlighted and robotic soccer is presented as an appropriate test bed for MAS. This survey does not focus exclusively on robotic systems. However, we believe that much of the prior research in non-robotic MAS is relevant to robotic MAS, and we explicitly discuss several robotic MAS, including all of those presented in this issue. <br> - </details>
