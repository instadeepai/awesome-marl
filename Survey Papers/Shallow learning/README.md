A key to the success of MAS is efficient and effective multiagent learning (MAL). The past 25 years have seen a great interest and tremendous progress in the field of MAL. This article introduces and overviews this field by presenting its fundamentals, sketching its historical development, and describing some key algorithms for MAL. Moreover, main challenges that the field is facing today are identified.<br> - </details>

Laurent and Nadine Le Fort-Piat. Cambridge University Press 2012<a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">   </a></summary> In the framework of fully cooperative multi-agent systems, independent (non-communicative) agents that learn by reinforcement must overcome several difficulties to manage to coordinate. This paper identifies several challenges responsible for the non-coordination of independent agents: Pareto-selection non-stationarity, stochasticity, alter-exploration and shadowed equilibria. A selection of multi-agent domains is classified according to those challenges: matrix games,Boutilier’s coordination game, predators pursuit domains and a special multi-state game.Moreover, the performance of a range of algorithms for independent reinforcementlearners is evaluated empirically.Those algorithms are Q-learning variants: decentralized Q-learning, distributedQ-learning, hystereticQ-learning, recursive frequency maximum Q-value and win-or-learn fast policy hillclimbing. Anoverview of the learning algorithms’ strengths and weaknesses against each challengeconcludes thepaper and can serve as a basis for choosing the appropriate algorithm for a new domain.Furthermore,the distilled challenges may assist in the design of new learning algorithms thatovercome theseproblems and achieve higher performance in multi-agent applications.<br> - </details>

The agents must instead discover a solutionon their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multi-agentlearn-ing concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This chapter reviews arepresenta-tive selection of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms for fullycooperative, fully competitive, and more general (neither cooperative norcompeti-tive) tasks. The benefits and challenges of MARL are described. A centralchallengein the field is the formal statement of a multi-agent learning goal; thischapter re-views the learning goals proposed in the literature. The problem domains whereMARL techniques have been applied are briefly discussed. Several MARL algo-rithms are applied to an illustrative example involving the coordinatedtransporta-tion of an object by two cooperative robots. In an outlook for the MARL field,a setof important open issues are identified, and promising research directions toaddressthese issues are outlined.<br> - </details>

This second edition has been extended with substantial new material on recent developments in the field, and has been revised and updated throughout. It provides a comprehensive, coherent, and readable introduction to the theory and practice of multiagent systems, while presenting a wealth of discussion topics and pointers into more advanced issues for those wanting to dig deeper.<br> - </details>

In this larger context, how (and perhaps whether) multiagent learning can be usefully applied in complex domains is still a large open question.<br> - </details>

JAAMAS 2005<a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">   </a></summary> Cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to MAS problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning, RL or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including RL, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources. Keywords: multi-agent systems, machine learning, multi-agent learning, cooperation, survey.<br> - </details>

In this survey we givean overview of multi-agent learning research in a spectrum of areas, in-cluding reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, game theory,complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics.MASs range in their description from cooperative to being competitivein nature. To muddle the waters, competitive systems can show appar-ent cooperative behavior, and vice versa. In practice, agents can showa wide range of behaviors in a system, that may either fit the label ofcooperative or competitive, depending on the circumstances. In this sur-vey, we discuss current work on cooperative and competitive MASs andaim to make the distinctions and overlap between the two approachesmore explicit.Lastly, this paper summarizes the papers of the first International work-shop on Learning and Adaptation in MAS (LAMAS) hosted at the fourthInternational Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi AgentSystems (AAMAS’05) and places the work in the above survey.<br> - </details>
